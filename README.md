# Floating_actionbar_android
This repo contains android files, build tools and xml code that create the Floating Action Bar 

A floating action button represents the primary action in an application.
A floating action button is used for a promoted action.

Shaped like a circled icon floating above the UI, it has an ink wash upon focus and lifts upon selection. When pressed, it may contain more related actions.

**Usage**
Only one floating action button is recommended per screen to represent the most common action.

**Behavior**
It animates onto the screen as an expanding piece of material, by default.

**Sizes**
Default: 56 x 56dp
Mini: 30 x 40dp
